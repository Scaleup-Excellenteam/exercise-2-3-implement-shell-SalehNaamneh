# Shell Implementation (C++)

This project is a **custom Unix-like shell** implemented in C++ as part of my programming coursework.  
While the repository was created through GitHub Classroom, **all the code and logic were implemented by me**.

## ‚ú® Features
- Interactive shell loop with user prompt  
- Execution of built-in commands (`cd`, `exit`, etc.)  
- Execution of external programs using `fork` and `exec`  
- Basic error handling for invalid commands  
- Support for command arguments

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies
- **C++**
- Linux system calls (`fork`, `exec`, `wait`)
